### Android

The options on Android are limited and easier to get around, but there are a few things that can help:

1. On their phone, open the browser and go to: google.com/preferences

2. Turn on SafeSearch

You can do this in any browser on any device and it will help prevent Google from returning inappropriate results.

## Privacy

### Facebook

Two things you want to be careful with on Facebook:

1. Who can see what you post. By default Facebook might be making what you post (pictures) publicly visible ot everyone on the internet. Use the settings below to make sure only approved friends can see what you and your kids post.
1. Who can ask to be friends with you and your kids. A lot of people accept friend requests if they don't know who the person is. This setting below shows where you can change that so only friends of friends can request to be your friend.

- Family safe routers. As long as a device is connected to wifi through these routers, they will be more protected. Keep in mind that no filters are perfect, but it does filter most harmful content.
